David Durieux, Frederic Mohier and Sebastien Coavoux met the 29 December 2016 to discuss about the first release for Alignak, the version 1.0.0 !

We have been received at the DCS company office at Lyon in France (DCS is our mainly partner, see [friends page](/ourfriends)).


The meeting was about the first release of Alignak and the review is:

* fix packaging problems for Alignak and the check packs, modules
* take decision about some issues and simplification of code
* decided for the future (version 2.0 or after) to use backend for all configuration and drop the cfg files support


We are near to release the first stable version ;)

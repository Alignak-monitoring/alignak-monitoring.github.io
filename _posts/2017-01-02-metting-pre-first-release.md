David Durieux, Frederic Mohier and Sebastien Coavoux met the 29 December 2016 to discuss about the first release for Alignak, the version 1.0.0 !

We held the meeting at the DCS company office at Lyon in France (DCS is our main partner, see [friends page](/ourfriends)).


The meeting was about the first official release of Alignak and the report is:

* fix packaging problems for Alignak and the check packs, modules
* make a decision about some issues and source code simplification
* decide for the future (version 2.0 or after) to use the backend for all configuration and drop the configuration based on flat files support


We are near to release the first stable version ;)

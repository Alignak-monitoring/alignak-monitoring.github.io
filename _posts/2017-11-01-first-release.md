Sure, we should have announced the first Alignak release when we released the 1.0 version of all the Alignak packages... almost one year ago up-to-now!

It is not too late to announce the first release now that all the major distros packages are available for almost all of Alignak stuff.

Since the first release, we already improved some few things and fixed small remaining bugs, but Alignak is now ready for production!

Check the [official project documentation](http://docs.alignak.net) to discover the main Alignak features.

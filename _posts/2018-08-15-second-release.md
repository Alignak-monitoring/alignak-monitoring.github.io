It has been a long time since the last major release of Alignak (Nov 2017 1.0 version)!

We used all this time to make some more tests and develop new improvements to Alignak core application: 
- a brand new configuration to make Alignak configuration easier
- the application is now packaged and well documented for system installation on major Linux / Unix
- the Alignak arbiter Web Services API has been refactored and enhanced to provide many information about Alignak and the monitored infrastructure
- many other bug fixes and improvements...

As of today, the Alignak version 2.0 is available as a release candidate for tests from our [download repositories](https://bintray.com/alignak/).

Check the [project installation documentation](http://docs.alignak.net/en/develop-environment/02_installation/index.html) to set-up and download Alignak.

We did a really huge effort to make the documentation as comprehensive as possible. If more information is needed, feel free to contact us!

`To be updated!`

Alignak has a demonstration server and Web site.

The url of the Web User Interface is: <a href="http://demo.alignak.net/" target="_blank">demo.alignak.net</a>. Use *admin* as username and *admin* as password to have a look on what is happening on our monitoring server.

You can set-up your own demo server thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/Alignak-monitoring-contrib/alignak-demo" target="_blank">Alignak demonstration repository</a>. The readme file of this project is the step by step installation procedure that got used to set-up our demonstration server. You can easily adapt this procedure to make it suit to your own configuration.

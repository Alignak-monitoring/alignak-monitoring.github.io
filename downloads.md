## Alignak repositories

Alignak packaging and download repositories for Linux/Unix is done thanks to the [Bintray software distribution](https://bintray.com/alignak/>). Check the [Alignak Bintray home page](https://bintray.com/alignak) for all the available packages.

Installing Alignak is documented in the [official documentation](http://docs.alignak.net/en/develop-environment/02_installation/index.html).

All the Alignak ecosystem applications and modules exist in separate stable and develop repositories. The `stable` repositories only contains versions that are robust and intensively tested.

The `develop` repositories contain all the other versions including all the new features. A branch-named version is made available as soon as a build is running in the project **C**ontinuous **I**ntegration and a develop version is made available as soon as the develop branch is updated.
